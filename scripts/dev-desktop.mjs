// One command to develop the desktop app from source. It:
//   1. builds the CLI, so a linked `dapi` (see symlink:create) runs the
//      latest code and the app's headless server matches it;
//   2. starts the web dev server (Vite on :5173), first reclaiming the port
//      from a Vite left behind by an earlier run that did not come down;
//   3. waits for that server, then launches Electron, which loads it.
// Ctrl-C tears the whole tree down.
